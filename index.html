        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Strangely enough for such a successful club, Bayern did not set the
          world alight straight away. After being founded in 1900, the club had
          to wait until 1932 for its first national championship. One title
          could not turn their fortunes around, however; in those years, Bayern
          were derided as "the Jew's club", and many important Jewish club
          officials had to leave the country due to the rise of Nazism in
          Germany. The post-war era brought its own troubles, with the club
          being relegated in 1955 and narrowly avoiding bankruptcy at the end of
          the decade. The only bright spot for Bayern was winning their first
          DFB-Pokal in 1957.
        </p>
        <h3>"The axis"</h3>
        <p>
          When the Bundesliga was founded in 1963, Bayern was not among the
          sixteen teams invited. Instead, they gained promotion two seasons
          later, led by three young players who would later be referred to as
          "the axis": Sepp Maier, Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd Müller. It was
          during their time at the club (1965–1979) that Bayern would finally
          turn into the powerhouse it is today. Those 14 years saw the club win
          four Bundesliga titles, four DFB-Pokals, a Cup Winners's Cup in 1967,
          as well as three straight European Cups from 1974 to 1976.
        </p>
        <h3>"FC Breitnigge"</h3>
        <p>
          The club's era of dominance continued with a team led by the dynamic
          duo of Paul Breitner and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, often jokingly
          referred to as FC Breitnigge due to the club's over-reliance on them.
          Overall, the 80s were a time of huge domestic success for the club,
          which won six additional Bundesligas and three DFB-Pokals during this
          period. European trophies were harder to come by, however, as the club
          lost its only two European Cup finals in 1982 and 1987.
        </p>
        <h3>Decline followed by a new grand era</h3>
        <p>
          In comparison, the early 90s were a time of turmoil at the club. After
          winning another title in 1990 and placing runners-up in the following
          season, Bayern ended the 1991/1992 season dangling dangerously close
          to the relegation zone. Losing to Norwich in the 1994 UEFA Cup was the
          final straw, and the club resorted to a change of personnel,
          appointing Beckenbauer as coach. Naturally, Der Kaiser proved himself
          a capable manager, and Bayern won its 13th title that same year,
          following it up with another one in 1997 and a DFB-Pokal in 1998.
          Ottmar Hitzfeld's appointment as coach at the start of the 1998/1999
          season signaled the club's big return to the European scene. During
          his six years with the club, Bayern won a Champions League and further
          asserted themselves as the top dog in German football, winning four
          Bundesligas and two DFB-Pokals. In 2005 the team moved from
          Olympiastadion (built for the 1972 Olympic Games) to the new Alianz
          Arena. After the shift, Bayern Munich would continue share stadium
          with TSV 1860 Munich. Even though Bayern won seven additional
          Bundesliga titles and six DFB-Pokals in the years that followed,
          international success was once again proving elusive. After not
          getting past the Champions League quarter-finals in the period from
          2002 to 2010, Bayern finally managed to win another competition title
          by defeating long-time rivals Borussia Dortmund 2-1 in the 2013
          finals.
